## About This Project

This is an interactive, single-page guide designed to help beginners get started with the **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) Challenge**. It synthesizes the core philosophy, key methodologies, winning strategies, and practical code from various community resources into one easy-to-digest format.

This guide was created as a personal learning project while preparing for the ARC Prize and is shared in the open-source spirit of the ARC community.
